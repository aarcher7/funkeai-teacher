## Datastore Administration

Google Datastore is used to store all application data. Here's how to access and manage it:

### Accessing Datastore
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to "Firestore" in the left menu (it may appear as "Datastore")
4. Click on "Data" to view the database entities

### Viewing Entities
Datastore contains three types of entities:
- **Notebook**: Contains notebook metadata and playlist items
- **User**: Stores teacher information and roles
- **Progress**: Tracks student progress through notebooks (created when students use the Chrome extension)

To view a specific entity type:
1. In the Datastore interface, click on the entity type in the "Kind" dropdown
2. Browse the list of entities
3. Click on any entity to view its details

### Example: Notebook Entity Structure
A typical Notebook entity contains:
- **name**: The notebook name (e.g., "Biology")
- **createdBy**: Email of the teacher who created it
- **playlist**: Array of content items with:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the item
  - **command**: The content text or URL
  - **type**: Content type (Prompt, Multimedia, etc.)
- **updatedAt**: Timestamp of the last update

### Example: Progress Entity Structure
When students use the Chrome extension, Progress entities track their completion:
- **progressKey**: Combined notebook ID and student email
- **notebookId**: ID of the notebook
- **userEmail**: Email of the student
- **completedItems**: Array of completed item IDs
- **updatedAt**: Last update timestamp

### Manually Editing Entities
While most changes should be made through the app interface, you can manually edit entities if needed:

1. Find and select the entity to edit
2. Click "Edit" at the top of the entity details panel
3. Modify properties as needed
4. Click "Save" to apply changes

> **Warning**: Manual edits can cause data inconsistencies if not done carefully.

### Running GQL Queries
You can run database queries using GQL (similar to SQL):

1. Click "Run Query" at the top of the Datastore interface
2. Enter a GQL query, for example:
   ```
   SELECT * FROM Notebook WHERE createdBy = 'teacher@example.com'
   ```
3. Click "Run" to execute the query

## Deploying Code Updates

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your code changes
3. Test locally with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```

5. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a pull request on GitHub
7. After review and merge, deploy using the steps above

### Updating Frontend Code Only

If you only need to update the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):

1. Edit the files in the repository:
   - `index.html` for the main interface
   - CSS styles (inline or in the style section)
   - JavaScript functions

2. Commit and push changes to GitHub

3. Deploy using the command:
   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy
   ```

### Viewing Deployment Logs

To monitor your application and troubleshoot issues:

1. View real-time logs:
   ```bash
   gcloud app logs tail
   ```

2. Check for errors or warnings in the logs
3. Make changes as needed to fix any issues
4. Redeploy with `gcloud app deploy`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Authentication problems**:
   - Check that the OAuth credentials are properly configured in the Google Cloud Console
   - Verify that the correct redirect URIs are set

2. **Data not saving**:
   - Remember to click the "Save Changes" button after making modifications
   - Check browser console for any errors
   - Verify API responses in Network tab of browser DevTools

3. **Deployment failures**:
   - Check the deployment logs for error messages
   - Verify that all required APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
